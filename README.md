Financial analysis is the process of evaluating businesses, projects, budgets, and other finance-related entities to determine their performance and suitability. Typically, financial analysis is used to analyze whether an entity is stable, solvent, liquid, or profitable enough to warrant a monetary investment. Below is an overview of the key components and steps involved in financial analysis:
Cash by Year: When focusing on an overview of cash by year and debt ratios, we dive into two crucial aspects of financial analysis: liquidity and solvency. These metrics help assess a company's ability to manage cash flows and meet both short-term and long-term obligations. 
Debt ratios: Debt ratios are financial metrics that provide insights into a company's leverage and its ability to meet long-term obligations.A higher ratio suggests higher leverage and potential financial risk.
Account receivable vs payable: Accounts Receivable (AR) and Accounts Payable (AP) are two key components of a companyâ€™s balance sheet and play crucial roles in managing cash flow and working capital.Accounts Receivable refers to the money owed to a company by its customers for goods or services that have been delivered but not yet paid for.Accounts payable represents the money a company owes to its suppliers or vendors for goods or services received but not yet paid for. It is recorded as a liability on the balance sheet.
